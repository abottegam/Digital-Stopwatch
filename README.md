# Digital-Stopwatch
Real time Digital stopwatch that has a Start/Stop button and a reset button with the application of a ripple carry adder using half adders, D-FFs, a clock divider, a BCD to 7-segment.

The Real-Time Digital Stopwatch implementation will have all the concepts we learned throughout Digital Logic Design combined. We will be able to fuse together the theoretical knowledge that we learned in class and the practical implementations that we constructed in the lab to build something with our own knowledge and labor. I was able to accomplish this project and gained more expertise in Digital Logic Designs.
